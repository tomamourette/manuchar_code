# Maintenance implementation
Maintenance assets keep the Fabric workspace healthy and automate recurring housekeeping tasks.

## Notebooks
| Notebook | Git location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_diagnostics` | `fabric/maintenance/maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_diagnostics.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Checks table health, file sizes and delta stats. |
| `maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_cleanup` | `fabric/maintenance/maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_cleanup.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Removes obsolete files, old checkpoints and temporary data. |
| `maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_optimization` | `fabric/maintenance/maintenance_notebook_lakehouse_optimization.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Optimises tables (vacuum, optimize) to maintain performance. |
| `maintenance_notebook_metadata_refresh` | `fabric/maintenance/maintenance_notebook_metadata_refresh.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Refreshes metadata tables (monitoring, catalogues) and synchronises documentation. |

## Semantic model refresh
See [[Data-BackBone-Fabric-Implementation-Documentation/Semantic-Model-Refresh-Configuration.md]] for detailed configuration of dataset refresh parameters, workspace ids and post refresh actions.

## Operational guidance
- Schedule maintenance notebooks outside business hours via the orchestration pipeline or Fabric scheduled runs.
- Review notebook output and attach summaries to the maintenance log. Capture any anomalies as Azure DevOps tasks.
- Before deleting historical data, confirm retention requirements with data owners and the security team.

## Deployment notes
- Export notebooks from Fabric after changes and commit new versions of `notebook-content.py`.
- Update `fabric/parameter.yml` if notebooks reference new workspace ids or connections.
- Test in TST first. Only promote to PRD once validation is complete and documented.
