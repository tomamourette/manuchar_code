# Reconciliation
A quick reference for the assets implementing reconciliation checks within the Data BackBone (DBB) platform.

## Fabric Artefacts
| Artefact | Git Location | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `reconciliation_pipeline_DBB` | `fabric/reconciliation/reconciliation_pipeline_DBB.DataPipeline/pipeline-content.json` | Executes reconciliation notebooks to validate data consistency after transformations. |
| `reconciliation_notebook` | `fabric/reconciliation/reconciliation_notebook.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Runs dbt-based KPI reconciliation checks comparing source and DBB fact outputs. |

## dbt Project
| Component | Path | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| Reconciliation models | `transformation/dbt/models/gold/reconciliation` | Contains reconciliation queries, results, and history models. |

## Operational Guidance
- Reconciliation runs automatically after each transformation pipeline.  
- Any mismatch causes the pipeline (and orchestration flow) to fail, ensuring only verified data proceeds.  
- Review details in the [reconciliation_notebook](reconciliation_notebook) documentation for check logic.
