# Orchestration

The **Orchestration** layer in the Data BackBone (DBB) platform coordinates and automates the end-to-end execution of all data product workloads.  
It ensures that integration, transformation, reconciliation, and semantic refresh processes run in the correct order and frequency across environments.

Each Data Product has its own dedicated orchestration pipeline (`orchestration_pipeline_<Data Product>`), providing modular and independent control while following a standardized structure.
