# Consumption

The **Consumption** layer is the final stage of the Data BackBone (DBB) workflow.  
It exposes validated and reconciled data to business users through **semantic models** and **Power BI reports** hosted in Fabric.

---

## Overview
Curated data from the Transformation and Reconciliation layers is published to semantic models in **Finance Group Reporting [<environment>]** workspaces.  
These workspaces contain one folder per **Data Product**, including its semantic model and related reports.

Dataset refreshes are orchestrated by the **`data_product_refresh_DBB`** pipeline, which triggers automatically after successful reconciliation and monitoring.

## Key Components

| **data_product_refresh_DBB** | Refreshes semantic models after validation. |
| **Finance Group Reporting Workspaces** | Host the semantic models and reports for each data product. |
