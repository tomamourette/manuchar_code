# Monitoring implementation
Monitoring assets help the team detect issues early and keep stakeholders informed.

## Fabric notebooks
| Notebook | Git location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monitoring_notebook_integration` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_notebook_integration.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Validates integration run freshness and row counts. |
| `monitoring_notebook_integration_validation` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_notebook_integration_validation.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Performs reconciliation checks between source and target totals. |
| `monitoring_notebook_integration_empty_check` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_integration_empty_check.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Flags mandatory tables that landed empty. |
| `monitoring_notebook_transformation` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_notebook_transformation.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Monitors transformation model freshness. |
| `monitoring_notebook_transformation_validation` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_notebook_transformation_validation.Notebook/notebook-content.py` | Applies business rule validation on curated data. |

## Power BI assets
| Asset | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monitoring semantic model | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_dashboard.SemanticModel` | Holds measures for pipeline health, SLA adherence and incident tracking. |
| Monitoring dashboard | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_dashboard.Report/report.json` | Visual interface for operations and leadership teams.

## Deployment and scheduling
- Notebooks are published via `deploy_workspace_items.py`. Ensure dependencies (`pyspark`, delta tables) are available in the workspace.
- Schedule notebooks via the orchestration pipeline after integration and transformation runs complete.
- Power BI assets refresh through the `refresh_semantic_models` pipeline.

## Operations
- Store monitoring outputs (dataframes or CSVs) in a dedicated monitoring folder inside the Lakehouse for audit.
- Log incidents in Azure DevOps and include notebook run ids for traceability.
- Update this page when new monitoring artefacts are introduced.
