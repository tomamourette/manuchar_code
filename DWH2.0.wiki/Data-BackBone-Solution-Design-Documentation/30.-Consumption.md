# Consumption solution design
The consumption layer turns curated warehouse tables into governed analytical products consumed through Power BI and downstream applications.

## Principles
- Publish certified semantic models per domain (Finance first) with clear ownership and SLA.
- Separate semantic models from reports so multiple experiences can reuse the same certified dataset.
- Apply Row Level Security (RLS) and Object Level Security (OLS) to enforce least privilege access.

## Components
- **Semantic models:** Deployed via Fabric semantic model items. Configuration and refresh details live in [[Data-BackBone-Fabric-Implementation-Documentation/50.-Maintenance.md#semantic-model-refresh]].
- **Power BI reports:** Packaged in dedicated workspaces. Monitoring dashboards reside in `fabric/monitoring` while finance reports are published to the Finance Group Reporting workspace (IDs defined in `fabric/parameter.yml`).
- **API consumers:** Approved downstream systems can query the SQL endpoint of `dbb_warehouse` or the XMLA endpoint of semantic models. Register consumers and capacities before granting access.

## Delivery pattern
1. Expose gold tables in `dds_finance`. Include calculation logic as measures wherever possible.
2. Build semantic models in Power BI Desktop connected to the warehouse or exported to Git via Fabric workspace download.
3. Configure refresh pipelines using the orchestration pipeline or the Semantic Model refresh template; document schedules and dependencies.
4. Apply RLS/OLS rules aligned with [[Data-BackBone-Solution-Design-Documentation/60.-Security.md]].
5. Certify the dataset and tag reports with the owning domain and SLA so consumers can trust the asset.

## Roadmap
- Expand data products to cover Controlling, Sales and Operations domains using the same standards.
- Introduce dataset health checks (refresh latency, query performance) as part of the monitoring dashboard.
- Document API usage guidelines for advanced consumers (for example Excel Pivot, external applications).
