# Testing and monitoring design
Testing and observability provide confidence that the Data BackBone delivers trustworthy data. This page outlines standards for validating pipelines and detecting issues early.

## Testing strategy
- **dbt tests:** Every model must include schema tests (not null, unique) and, where relevant, custom tests stored under `transformation/dbt/tests`. Run `dbt build` in TST before promoting changes.
- **Data quality rules:** Implement business rule checks in the gold layer or monitoring notebooks. Document expectations in [[Data-BackBone-Solution-Design-Documentation/Data-Quality-framework-and-implementation.md]].
- **Regression packs:** Maintain SQL snippets or notebooks per critical KPI to compare production against acceptance before go-live.

## Monitoring strategy
- **Pipeline telemetry:** Integration pipelines write run status, duration and record counts to `dbb_warehouse.meta.monitoring_integration`. Use this table to drive dashboards and alerts.
- **Monitoring notebooks:** Notebook templates in `fabric/monitoring` validate load freshness, table emptiness and reconcile source versus target counts.
- **Power BI dashboard:** The monitoring semantic model and report surface health indicators for operations and leadership teams.

## Alerting and incident response
1. Pipelines mark failures in the monitoring table and trigger notifications via Fabric alerts.
2. On-call engineers run the relevant monitoring notebook to gather diagnostics and document in the incident ticket.
3. Mitigations (replays, backfills) must be tracked in Azure DevOps and reflected in the monitoring dashboard.

## Continuous improvement
- Capture post-incident reviews and feed improvements back into tests or monitoring rules.
- Expand automated coverage whenever manual checks are performed more than twice.
- Keep this page and linked runbooks current as the platform evolves.
