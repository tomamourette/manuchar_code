Data Access Security in Microsoft Fabric
========================================

Overview
--------

In Microsoft Fabric, security is not just about protecting infrastructure—it's about ensuring that **the right data reaches the right users at the right time**, based on their identity and role within the organization. This document describes the approach to **data access security**, with a focus on leveraging native Microsoft Fabric capabilities to enforce scalable, maintainable, and automated access rules across data products.

Goals of the Security Layer
---------------------------

*   **Control data exposure per user/group**
    
*   **Secure data products and semantic models** at different levels of granularity
    
*   **Ensure automation and consistency** in access control
    
*   **Avoid manual access management in Fabric itself**
    
*   **Respect functional business needs for access segmentation**
    

Security Scope in the Data Platform
-----------------------------------

Security in Fabric is implemented as an integrated layer between:
*   **Data ingestion & transformation** (ETL pipelines)
    
*   **Data storage** (Lakehouses, Warehouses)
    
*   **Data presentation** (Semantic Models / Power BI)
    
The focus of **Data Access Security** is on the **Gold Layer**, where curated and validated **data products** are made available to internal and external stakeholders. This is where the **Access Layer Control** is enforced.

> 🔒 Note: Developers, especially in non-production environments, typically have access to all data for development and testing purposes. The access control mechanisms described here are designed to govern **end-user access** to published data products.

Granularity of Access Control
-----------------------------

Access control is primarily applied at the **data product level**, which in the current implementation maps to:
*   **Semantic Models in Power BI / Fabric**
    
*   Anchored on top of the unified storage layer (OneLake)
    
As Fabric evolves, and once the ecosystem matures further, an evaluation can be move to move toward **OneLake Unified Security**—allowing consistent access enforcement across all data access paths within OneLake, beyond just semantic models.

Core Fabric Capabilities Used
-----------------------------

We use the following Microsoft Fabric features to implement data access security:

### 1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**

*   Restricts data **within tables** based on the user’s identity.
    
*   Implemented via DAX filters in semantic models.
    
*   Dynamically filters rows using mappings between Microsoft Entra ID groups and business domains.
    
*   Explained in detail in the document: _Implementing Row-Level Security in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI_.
    

### 2. **Object-Level Security (OLS)**

*   Restricts access to **entire tables or columns**.
    
*   Useful for hiding sensitive fields or full datasets from users.
    
*   Applied at the semantic model metadata level using tools like Tabular Editor or XMLA scripting.
    
*   Described in the document: _Implementing Object-Level Security in Microsoft Fabric and Power BI_.
    

Central Role of Microsoft Entra ID Groups
-----------------------------------------

Access management is governed through **Microsoft Entra ID groups**. These groups are:
*   Created in collaboration with Security and business owners
    
*   Mapped to access rules (e.g., which countries, products, or entities a user may view)
    
*   Synchronized with Fabric to dynamically reflect user roles
    

### Why Entra ID?

*   Ensures access rules reflect organizational structure
    
*   Prevents manual ACL (access control list) management in Fabric
    
*   Enables security enforcement at runtime (e.g., during ETL or model refresh)
    
Fabric semantic models retrieve the user’s identity at query time via `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` or equivalent constructs. These are matched against Entra ID-derived access mappings during ETL, resulting in a secure, user-specific data experience.

Automation and Maintenance
--------------------------

All access logic is automated via:
*   **ETL logic** that extracts group membership and builds security matrices
    
*   **Scheduled sync with Microsoft Graph API** to reflect current Entra group memberships
    
*   **Dynamic filtering in models**, avoiding static hardcoded rules
    
This architecture ensures the access layer is:
*   **Self-maintaining**
    
*   **Role-based and scalable**
    
*   **Aligned with enterprise identity governance policies**
    

Conclusion
----------

Security in Microsoft Fabric is implemented as a **data access layer**, not a manual control mechanism. By leveraging **Row-Level Security**, **Object-Level Security**, and **Microsoft Entra ID groups**, we can enforce secure and scalable data access across all layers of the platform—from ingestion to presentation—while meeting functional business requirements. Access control is applied at the level of **data products in the Gold Layer**, ensuring that stakeholders—internal or external—only see what they are authorized to. As Fabric’s unified governance and access tooling matures, this strategy will evolve to support **OneLake Unified Security** as a more centralized enforcement point.
