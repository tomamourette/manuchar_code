# Application landscape
The Data BackBone platform groups assets by workload so teams can navigate and own components effectively. This section links the business capabilities to their technical implementation.

## Core workloads
- **Integration** ingests data from Dynamics, Boomi, MDS and affiliate feeds into `dbb_lakehouse`. Metadata lives in `integration/integration_sources.csv` and `integration_source_list.csv` per source.
- **Transformation** uses dbt models (`transformation/dbt`) and Fabric notebooks (`fabric/transformation`) to materialise Data Vault and dimensional outputs inside `dbb_warehouse`.
- **Consumption** exposes certified semantic models and Power BI reports. The Finance domain publishes to dedicated workspaces referenced in `fabric/parameter.yml`.
- **Monitoring** captures operational telemetry through Fabric notebooks and Power BI dashboards stored under `fabric/monitoring`.
- **Maintenance** delivers optimisation, clean-up and metadata refresh notebooks stored under `fabric/maintenance`.

## Application components
| Layer | Fabric item | Git location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Integration | `integration_pipeline_DBB` | `fabric/integration` | Master pipeline that orchestrates per source pipelines and writes monitoring records |
| Integration | `integration_pipeline_source_*` | `fabric/integration/integration_sources` | Parameterised pipelines for each source (Dynamics, Boomi, MDS, etc) |
| Transformation | `transformation_pipeline_DBB` | `fabric/transformation` | Runs dbt jobs and supporting notebooks |
| Transformation | `transformation_notebook` | `fabric/transformation/transformation_notebook.Notebook` | Applies complex business logic not yet in dbt |
| Storage | `dbb_lakehouse` | `fabric/dbb_lakehouse.Lakehouse` | Raw and curated delta tables with shortcuts to external sources |
| Storage | `dbb_warehouse` | `fabric/dbb_warehouse.Warehouse` | SQL endpoint consumed by dbt, monitoring and Power BI |
| Monitoring | `monitoring_dashboard` | `fabric/monitoring/monitoring_dashboard.*` | Power BI dashboard and semantic model for operational metrics |
| Maintenance | `maintenance_*` notebooks | `fabric/maintenance` | Scheduled health checks, clean-up and optimisation |

## Cross cutting capabilities
- **Security:** enforced via workspace roles, Fabric item permissions and Row Level Security models (see [[Data-BackBone-Solution-Design-Documentation/60.-Security.md]]).
- **Observability:** Fabric notebooks write to `meta.monitoring_integration` in `dbb_warehouse`; Power BI dashboards surface load health.
- **Cost management:** Resource usage is analysed in the `Cost-Management` section and aligned with Fabric capacity telemetry.

## Future roadmap
- Extend the application landscape to additional domains by reusing the same folder structure and pipeline templates.
- Gradually migrate bespoke notebook logic into dbt models for maintainability.
- Introduce automated data quality scoring surfaced through the monitoring dashboard.
