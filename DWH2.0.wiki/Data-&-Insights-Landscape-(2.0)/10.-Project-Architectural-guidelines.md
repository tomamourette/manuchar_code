# Project architectural guidelines
This section captures the architectural guardrails that govern delivery of the Data BackBone programme. Refer to the subpages for detailed standards and step by step instructions.

## What to expect
- **Architectural principles:** [[Data-&-Insights-Landscape-(2.0)/10.-Project-Architectural-guidelines/10.1.-Architectural-Principles]] summarises the non-negotiable principles (automation first, modular design, governed access).
- **CI/CD guidance:** [[Data-&-Insights-Landscape-(2.0)/10.-Project-Architectural-guidelines/CICD-setup-for-the-DBB]] explains branching, pipeline configuration and environment promotion.
- **Environment build runbook:** [[Data-&-Insights-Landscape-(2.0)/10.-Project-Architectural-guidelines/Step-by-Step-Process-of-Setting-up-of-the-Quality-Environment]] describes how to stand up a new Fabric workspace from scratch.

## How to use these guidelines
1. Review the principles before proposing architectural changes or onboarding a new domain.
2. Align project plans with the CI/CD process to avoid manual deployments.
3. Update the runbook when the Fabric provisioning process changes or new automation becomes available.

## Responsibilities
- The architecture board reviews updates to this section and keeps the principles current.
- Delivery teams must reference and comply with these guidelines when raising design decisions.
- Operations validates that environments adhere to the documented setup at least once per quarter.
