## Overview
- Waves: Epics by Wave; Features per Phase with UC in title.
- Phase 5 is the delivery engine; source onboarding tracked per-source at Story level.
- Role = Activity on Task; time booked per person; WBS ID in titles for parity with MS Project.

## DevOps PM Setup
# Azure DevOps Project Management Setup

This guide defines how we structure work in Azure DevOps so it stays in sync with the MS Project WBS, supports role-based execution and time tracking, and reflects delivery priority by Waves and Phases.

## Goals
- Keep 1:1 parity with MS Project WBS at the User Story level (via WBS ID in the title).
- Track delivery and source onboarding in Phase 5 while keeping earlier phases visible.
- Enforce Role at the Task level using the built-in `Activity` field (single assignee, time booking per person).
- Make cross-Wave priority clear and reportable (Epics by Wave).

## Backlog Hierarchy
- Epic: Wave container
  - Naming: `Wave {N} — {Name or Timeline}` (e.g., `Wave 1 — Q1 Priority`).
  - Scope: All Features (Phases) and Use Case work that belong to the Wave window.
- Feature: Phase bucket per Use Case
  - Naming: `[UC{ID}] P{Phase} {Short Phase Name}`
  - Examples: `[UC8] P1 Determine Information Needs`, `[UC8] P5 Implement Roadmap`.
  - Note: Phase 5 Features include all delivery and source onboarding stories.
- User Story: Single WBS line instance (deliverable/governance or per-source)
  - Deliverable/governance stories map 1:1 to WBS lines.
  - Source-instance stories (Phase 5, e.g., 5.2.*) are cloned per source but keep the same WBS ID.
- Task: Single person’s unit of work (time booking, role-specific via `Activity`).

## Areas and Iterations
- Areas: one per Use Case (e.g., `UC8`), plus optional cross-cutting areas (e.g., `Shared/Backbone`).
  - We use Area to represent the UC; no separate `UC` field is needed.
- Iterations: sprint cadence aligned to the MS Project schedule (dates match the plan).

## Fields and Rules (Lean)
- User Story
  - No custom field for `WBS ID`, `UC`, `Phase`, `Source`, or `Deliverable`.
  - Those attributes are expressed through naming and Area:
    - UC → Area path (e.g., `UC8`).
    - WBS ID → in title prefix.
    - Phase → derivable from WBS ID, not a separate field.
    - Source (when applicable) → in title suffix.
    - Deliverable (when applicable) → in title suffix.
- Task
  - Use `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Activity` as the required Role field; extend values to match roles (Design, Data Engineering, BI Data Engineering, DevOps, Testing, Documentation, Requirements).
  - No copy-down fields from Story; Tasks inherit UC via Area and context via parent link.
- Validation (recommended)
  - Require `Activity` on Task.
  - Optional: policy to encourage the naming patterns below.

## Naming Conventions
- Epic (Wave): `Wave {N} — {Name}` (e.g., `Wave 2 — Q2 Delivery`).
- Feature (Phase per UC): `[UC{ID}] P{N} {Phase Name}`.
- User Story — deliverable/governance: `[UC{ID}] {WBS ID} {Task Name} — Deliverable` (append `— Deliverable` only when applicable).
- User Story — source-instance: `[UC{ID}] {WBS ID} {Task Name} — Source: {System}`.
- Task: `[UC{ID}] {WBS ID} [{Activity}] — {Action/Artifact}`.

## Dependency Model (Story Level)
- Use Predecessor/Successor links between Stories to mirror WBS sequencing.
- Examples
  - `5.2.4.2` (per source) depends on `5.2.4.1` and `5.2.3`.
  - `5.2.4.3` depends on `5.2.4.2` and `5.2.3`.
  - `5.3.4` depends on `5.3.3`.
  - `5.4.*` depends on relevant `5.2.*` and `5.3.*` for the UC/source.

## Definition of Ready (DoR)
- Epic (Wave)
  - Wave scope and timeline agreed; UC list enumerated.
  - Entry criteria: funding/approval recorded; risks and cross-Wave dependencies captured.
  - Delivery Plans updated to include the Epic.
- Feature (Phase per UC)
  - Area set to UC; Phase implied by Feature title.
  - Stakeholders identified; entry/exit criteria defined.
  - Dependencies to previous phases (P1–P4) linked.
- User Story (WBS line / deliverable)
  - Title follows naming: `[UC] {WBS} {Name}` (+ `— Source: …` or `— Deliverable` when applicable).
  - Description includes the WBS Title/Description; acceptance criteria added.
  - Dependencies linked (e.g., `5.2.4.2` → `5.2.4.1`, `5.2.3`).
  - Sign‑off: use a dedicated WBS story (as per MS Project WBS), not per story fields.
- Task (per person)
  - Title follows naming: `[UC] {WBS} [{Activity}] — {Action/Artifact}`.
  - `Activity` set (required), estimate provided (hours), acceptance notes clear.
  - Links to code/docs/test artifacts as relevant.

## Templates (Work Item Templates)
- Feature template: `[UC{ID}] P{N} {Phase Name}` (Area set to the UC).
- Story template — Deliverable
  - Title pattern: `[UC{ID}] {WBS ID} {Task Name} — Deliverable`.
  - Body seeded with WBS Title/Description.
  - Child Task templates per typical roles (BI DE model; DE orchestration; DevOps release gates).
- Story template — Source Instance
  - Title pattern: `[UC{ID}] {WBS ID} {Task Name} — Source: {System}`.
  - Child Task templates for DE connectivity/config, mapping, DQ, orchestration, testing.
- Task templates (by Activity)
  - Design, Data Engineering, BI Data Engineering, DevOps, Testing, Documentation.

## Boards and Views
- Delivery Plans
  - Plan 1: `Waves` — lanes by Epic (Wave) with Features (Phases) and Stories visible; dependency lines on Stories.
  - Plan 2: `UC Delivery` — lanes by Area (UC), grouped by Feature (Phase); filter to Phase 5 for delivery focus.
- Dashboards
  - Deliverables Status (Stories with `— Deliverable` in title, by UC/Phase).
  - Source Onboarding (Stories with `— Source:` in title, grouped by UC and source).
  - Time vs Estimate (Task Remaining/Completed Work rolled up by WBS/Activity via title parsing).

## Reporting
- Use Azure DevOps Analytics (or Power BI). Derive keys from title and Area:
  - UC: from Area path (e.g., `UC8`).
  - WBS ID: parse from title prefix `(\d+(?:\.\d+)*)` after `[UCx]`.
  - Source: parse `— Source: (.+)$` when present.
  - Deliverable: title contains `— Deliverable`.
- Key reports
  - Baseline vs Actual effort per WBS and Activity.
  - Deliverables done vs planned per UC.
  - Per‑source progress across 5.2.* WBS lines.

## Working Agreements
- One WBS line → one Story; duplicate as source-instance stories where needed in Phase 5.
- Every participating role creates their own Task(s) under the Story; each Task has exactly one assignee and `Activity` set.
- Tasks are sized 4–16 hours; split if they cross sprints.
- Only deliverable Stories (those with `— Deliverable`) require business sign‑off; add a distinct WBS story for final UC sign‑off per the WBS.

## Examples
- Epic: `Wave 1 — Q1 Priority`
- Feature: `[UC8] P5 Implement Roadmap`
- Story (deliverable): `[UC8] 5.3.4 Create semantic model — Deliverable`
- Story (source-instance): `[UC8] 5.2.4.2 Data SourceSync replication — Source: SAPBE`
- Task: `[UC8] 5.2.4.2 [Data Engineering] — Build replication job for Company, Customer tables`

---
This setup keeps MS Project WBS as the reference plan while making DevOps the system of execution. It captures role-based work at the Task level (via Activity), supports per‑source tracking in Phase 5, and enables Wave → Phase → UC visibility for planning and reporting.

- With this project, we aim to create a Modern Data Platform to improve reliability, availability, maintainability and security of data usage.
- The way to achieve this
- is by following industry standards for analytical platforms, building a medallion architecture with 3 layers (bronze, silver, gold).
Notes:
> Evaluate the current data landscape, elaborate data needs for all business areas and design to-be functional governance for data analytics Establish and deliver a future proof Data Lake/Warehouse for the Manuchar Group that will be able to support current & future needs (MS Fabric Based) Deliver data sets with governance and dashboards to unlock these products to the data community Improve existing data quality and availability 2

## Slide 3 — 2. General project information
- Recap & agreed on the global scope of the project
- 3
- In scope:
- Creation of a modern data platform to improve reliability, availability, maintainability and security of data usage
- A business lead project with 3 (independent UC) phases and 3 (UC related) phases We foresee 4 waves
- (7 UC’s) from Q3 2025 to Q4 2026
- End-to-end design & delivery
- at
- the front-end different data products (fixed reports & semantic models)allowing analysis on:
- Volume, GM and revenue by product, customer, affiliate and sales-person
- Open Sales orders per product customer affiliate and sales-person
- Inventory (volume, $) by product, location and affiliate
- Purchase orders by product, supplier, location and affiliate
- Out of scope:
- Integrate links to dashboards on
- Manuchar
- Intranet
- Workflow to capture/follow up SR’s after
- hypercare
- (will be handled “out of project”)
- Use and training on AI tools e.g. CoPilot in conjunction with
- PowerBI
- semantic models and reports
- Training/video for worldwide affiliate users (beyond HQ key users)
- Some legacy reports will still be running on the old platform (with
- impacton
- /the increase of the
- Opex
- ). Therefore the analyses (listing/evaluating) of the old reports destiny needs must be done by analysts (legacy reporting) with knowledge of the 'old' systems. The semantic model is only tested against the described/agreed Business Requirements.

## Slide 4 — 2. General project information
- Internal dependencies of the project NDB
- 4
- 1
- TPRM (new element)
- Current State: Local customer/vendor IDs are unified through MDS tables mapping to global "golden" keys.
- Target State: TPRM Party Master will become the authoritative source for global customer/vendor data.
- Critical Gap: Key solution components (UC2, UC3, UC4, UC8) for vendor and customer integration are not yet implemented.
- Risk: Delay will result in significant technical debt and costly rework.
- Action Required: Implementation of missing components to ensure readiness for
- TPRM integration.
- 2 PIM
- Current State: MDS tables facilitate product unification and hierarchy creation across affiliates.
- Target State: PIM will be the centralized source for product master data and hierarchy management.
- Issue: Previous solution design for this transition was not implemented.
- Risk: High technical debt and potential disruption across product use cases upon PIM deployment.
- Action Required: Reassess and implement a future-proof solution that supports seamless migration to
- PIM.

> 4

## Slide 5 — 2. General project information
- Internal dependencies of the project NDB
- 5
- 3 MTM
- Current State: Both MTM and
- Dycorade
- are used for order intake reporting.
- Challenge: As affiliates shift from MTM to
- Dycotrade
- , a seamless reporting transition is needed (e.g. historical MTM orders vs. new
- Dycotrade
- orders).
- Strategic Impact: MTM remains a core system (e.g. ESG Carbon Calculations) and must align with the
- Manuchar
- Information Model.
- Action Required: Ensure dual-system support and transition planning without data or reporting loss.
- 4 MONA
- Upcoming Change: MONA will move to the cloud, introducing new data tables and logic.
- Risk: Existing ingestion and processing pipelines rely on on-premises MONA.
- Action Required: Assess and adapt all relevant data flows and logic before the cloud migration deadline.
- 5 Decommissioning On-Prem Infrastructure
- Context: On-prem Data Warehouse (DWH) and MDS logic are deeply embedded in current data integration and reporting pipelines.
- Transition Goal: Migrate to the new Affiliate Direct Data Exchange and cloud infrastructure.
- Uncertainty: Lack of clarity on how to transition without disrupting business-critical reporting.
- Risk: High impact on existing solutions if decommissioning proceeds without proper mitigation.
- Action Required: Develop a transition roadmap, validate equivalency of new data sources, and ensure continuity of reporting capabilities.
